This README file will walk you through how to run our Homework 4 Jupyter notebook, which runs two linear regression exercises.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies and packages are required to be installed on the host machine in order to run the script:
 - Python (>= 3.5)
 - Jupyter
 - Juptyer Notebooks
 - yellowbrick
 - seaborn
 - pandas
 - random
 - math
 - numpy
 - sklearn
 - matplotlib
 - scipy

## Walkthrough

1. Use Git command line or a Git UI to clone the repo (https://github.com/LiffAM1/CSCI4120_Group8.git)
2. In a terminal, cd to the directory where you cloned the repo to.
3. Run the command 'jupyter notebook' to start jupyter. Click on the HW4_Regularization.ipynb file to open it.
4. Run the notebook by pressing 'Run'.

## Results
Comparing the three models (Ridge, Lasso, and Linear Regression) we got the following results:
Ridge alpha: 0.9066524426601507
Ridge score: 0.7699127844284409
Lasso alpha: 0.9219921682884018
Lasso score: 0.7697332051677273
Linear score: 0.7691752923789884

The Ridge model performed the best by a small amount.
