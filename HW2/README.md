This README file will walk you through how to run our Homework 2 Jupyter notebook, which runs the KNN algorithm on a generated dataset and produces accuracy and confusion matrix values for the prediction.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies and packages are required to be installed on the host machine in order to run the script:
 - Python (>= 3.5)
 - Jupyter
 - Juptyer Notebooks
 - yellowbrick
 - seaborn
 - pandas
 - random
 - math
 - numpy
 - sklearn
 - matplotlib

## Walkthrough

1. Use Git command line or a Git UI to clone the repo (https://github.com/LiffAM1/CSCI4120.git)
2. In a terminal, cd to the directory where you cloned the repo to.
3. Run the command 'jupyter notebook' to start jupyter. Click on the HW2_Kmeans.ipynb file to open it.
4. Run the notebook by pressing 'Run'.

## Results
We predicted that 4 was the best K value for the dataset. The accuracy was predicted to be 0.5. The confusion matrix below shows the details of where the model was correct and incorrect.![kmeansconfusion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22064340/134613142-207730cf-ac40-4d59-bf97-38738271bcba.PNG)
